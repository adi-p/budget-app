FOR SURE
- Use string ressources - Internationalization? Currency?
- styling
    - add trash button to items
    - make action buttons icons -> on hover? or ... ? 
        - I think ... is better
    - get better colours
    - better item list

- change README.md to have relevant info
- make textbox its own component?
- add proptypes - half done
- better linting
- 


MAYBE
- add back end
    - Typescript?
    - if this ever gets done, logic with ID will need to be looked at again
    - add saving capability
- add a side bar (choose page to edit) -> only make sense with a backend
- field validation? like for value is a number and name isn't empty
- add dates to items? -> is that useful?

- add tests -> front end and back end
- use redux

- get own jira board to replace this file
