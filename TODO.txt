Order of business -> (n)

URGENT
    - fix the focus on element issues (1)


IN PROGRESS

- add tags to items
    - need to think about the structure that tag have.
    - filter by tags

* important

FOR SURE
- Use string ressources - Internationalization? Currency?
- styling
    - this generally needs improvement
    - add trash button to items
    - make action buttons icons -> on hover? or [...] ? 
        - I think [...] is better
    - get better colours
    - better item list
    - button styling needs work

- change README.md to have relevant info
- make textbox its own component?
- better linting
- redux 
    - Add tests for reducers * (3)
    - figure out component vs. container splitting *
        - really need to figure out where logic should be done without
          passing too many props
        - should add/remove/update all be done at the same place?
    - lots of actions and reducers are the same
        - look into a solution for this if possible

MAYBE
- use react hooks
- Typescript for everything? * (4) 
    - would help with intellisence a lot 
    - ++++: Having just come back from doing a bunch of F#, the lack of typing and compiler error that warn me about typos etc, is hurting
- add back end (2)
    - Typescript? F#/Giraff? C#/.NET Core? Probably Express.
    - if this ever gets done, logic with ID will need to be looked at again
    - add saving capability

    - look into redux saga for side effects for redux (Or some kind of equivalent)
        - I've heard saga is not supported well any more
            - There are alternatives.

- add a side bar (choose page to edit) -> only make sense with a backend
- field validation? like for value is a number and name isn't empty
    - show validation errors to user
- add dates to items? -> is that useful?

- add tests -> front end and back end (2;3;5)
- get own jira board to replace this file
    - trello?

- drag and drop items and categories
    - ordering?

- have an empty item box at the bottom of each category instead of an add item button
    - the add item button is ugly when there are several categories
- have tool buttons show up on hover

- total doesn't always have the right precision.

- Design
    - Have a "Budget Plan" page -> rough outline of budget goals
        - Have categories and sub categories 
            - Goals per category
            - Maybe allow user to associate colour to make finding it better
        - User can assign items in their budget to categories in the Plan
            - sub categories? tags?
            - search per category
                - Does this become DB like?
